## The neoinmatrix personal page 
Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you know something. What you know you can't explain but you feel it. You've felt it in your entire life, felt that something is wrong in the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?
